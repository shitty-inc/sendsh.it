> Sendsh.it is a quick and easy way to send one-time and locally encrypted files to your friends

## Description

Your file is encrypted in the browser using the [Triplesec](http://keybase.github.io/triplesec/) library with a random key generated by its PRNG. The encrypted file is then uploaded to the [backend api](https://github.com/shitty-inc/sendshit-api) which stores it in S3 and returns a unique ID.

This is combined with your locally generated key to produce a unique url you can share with someone else. Once they visit the url the site will download the file and decrypt it in their browser.

Files are deleted after being downloaded or once they are over 24 hours old.

## Other Apps

* [Sendshit API](https://github.com/shitty-inc/sendshit-api) - Backend API for all sendsh.it clients
* [Sendshit CLI](https://github.com/shitty-inc/sendshit-cli) - Cross platform command line client
* [Sendshit MacOS App](https://github.com/shitty-inc/sendshit-app) - MacOS menubar client

## Disclaimer

I am not an expert in cryptography. If you have something important to keep secret please think about using a peer reviewed and audited service. This is just an experiment with in browser encryption and node.js.
